Itâ€™s been amazing to watch the Xata community grow since our public launch last November. From [showcasing work on our Discord](https://discord.com/channels/996791218879086662/1001924127705272361) to community contributions, itâ€™s been exciting to see what folks are creating with Xata. Today weâ€™ll be putting the community spotlight on [Kerdo Kurs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerdokurs/), the creator of [xata-go](https://github.com/kerdokurs/xata-go), a Go SDK for Xata.

Kerdo is a student and developer based out of Estonia and currently in his third year at the [University of Tartu](https://ut.ee/en) Institute of Computer Science. Outside of his typical student responsibilities, he is also a tech lead for the Mathematics-Informatics student society and a full time employee of [Avokaado](https://avokaado.io/).

## Discovering Xata

Kerdo stumbled upon Xata while searching for a serverless database solution for his universities student society and was immediately drawn to Xataâ€™s always-on free tier and full-text search capabilities.

> One of the selling points was the free tier, it was quite amazing in my opinion. With 750,000 rows, it makes it really easy to kickstart a project. The built in full-text search also sounded perfect for the features that Iâ€™d like to build. Itâ€™s really nice to not have to spin up a separate service for search.

In addition to exploring Xata for his student society, Kerdo also appreciated Xata workspaces for multi-tenancy support and data segmentation of future use cases.

## Building the Go SDK

The student society was planning to build some internal systems and was in need of a managed database. Xata was nearly a perfect fit. The only problem? Their entire system was written in Go. Using this as an opportunity to learn Go a bit more deeply, Kerdo decided to create an SDK.

Thinking that he canâ€™t be the only one looking for an Xata SDK in Go, he decided to open source it. And Kerdo was right, not only is this his most starred repository, but heâ€™s also receiving questions from the Xata community. Weâ€™ve seen some traction amongst Go enthusiasts and have been pointing them to his SDK.

Kerdo set out on this open source journey with two goals in mind. Not only did he want to share his work with the broader community, but he also wanted build a better SDK with similarly interested developers. Having seen a number of community contributed issues already, weâ€™d say heâ€™s accomplished both goals.

## The power of community

Kerdos story is a testament to the power of open source and the importance of community. Weâ€™re really excited to share his story and hope it inspires others. Thank you Kerdo for your contributions to the Xata community, we look forward to seeing what you build next!

If youâ€™d like to take `xata-go` for a spin or make a contribution yourself, be sure to check out the repository [here](https://github.com/kerdokurs/xata-go). Go is one of the many languages we have on our roadmap to support. If thereâ€™s another SDK youâ€™d like see on our roadmap, submit a feature request [here](https://xata.canny.io/feature-requests) or come chat with us directly on [Discord](https://xata.io/discord).
